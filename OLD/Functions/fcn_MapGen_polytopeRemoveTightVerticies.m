% fcn_MapGen_polytopeRemoveTightVerticies
% removes verticies of polytopes that are too close to each other, 
% measured by a tolerance
% 
% Sometimes, when shrinking, the new verticies are particularly close to 
% each other to where an edge has a trivial length. To prevent this, we 
% get rid of one of any vertices that are too close to each other. This 
% proximity is set by a user-defined tolerance.

%    (fig_num) ...
%    )
% 
% INPUTS:
% 
%     polytopes: an individual structure or structure array of 'polytopes' 
%     type that stores the polytopes to be evaluated
% 
%     tolerance: a numeric value that defines how close points should be 
%     to be removed
% 
%     (optional inputs)
%
%     fig_num: any number that acts as a figure number output, causing a 
%     figure to be drawn showing results.
% 
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% 
%     cleaned_polytope: the resulting polytope after close edges are 
%     removed.
