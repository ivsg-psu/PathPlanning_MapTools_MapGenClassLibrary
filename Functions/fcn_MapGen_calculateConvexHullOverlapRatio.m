function [convexHullOverlapRatio, areaOverlap, areaOccupied] = ...
    fcn_MapGen_calculateConvexHullOverlapRatio(polytopes, varargin)

% fcn_MapGen_calculateConvexHullOverlapRatio
% calculates the convex hull of every obstacle.  The area of the overlap between
% these hulls relative to the total occupied area
%
% FORMAT:
%
%     [convexHullOverlapRatio, areaOverlap, areaOccupied] = ...
%     fcn_MapGen_calculateConvexHullOverlapRatio( polytopes, (fig_num))
%
% INPUTS:
%
%     polytopes: the structure of 'polytopes' type that stores the
%     polytopes to be expanded. 
%
%     (optional inputs)
%
%      fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%      input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%      up code to maximize speed. As well, if given, this forces the
%      variable types to be displayed as output and as well makes the input
%      check process verbose.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%     covex_hull_overlap_ratio: portion of overlapping convex hull area to total obstacle area
%
%     areaOverlap: area of overlap
%
%     areaOccupied: area occupied
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
%     fcn_DebugTools_checkInputsToFunctions
%     MATLAB's polyshape object and union object function (method)

% REVISION HISTORY:
%
% 2024_02_23, Steve Harnett
% -- first write of function
% 2025_04_16, Steve Harnett
% -- add legend to plotting
% 2025_04_25 by Sean Brennan
% -- added global debugging options
% -- switched input checking to fcn_DebugTools_checkInputsToFunctions
% 2025_04_29 by Sean Brennan
% -- Fixed script mis-labeling in the docstrings
% 2025_07_15 by Sean Brennan
% -- Fixed missing output descriptions in docstrings
% 2025_07_17 by Sean Brennan
% -- standardized Debugging and Input checks area, Inputs area
% -- made codes use MAX_NARGIN definition at top of code, narginchk
% -- made plotting flag_do_plots and code consistent across all functions

% TO DO
% -- none
