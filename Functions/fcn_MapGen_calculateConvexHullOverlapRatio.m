% calculates the convex hull of every obstacle.  The area of the overlap between
% these hulls relative to the total occupied area

% FORMAT:
%
% function [ ...
% convex_hull_overlap_ratio...
% ] = ...
% fcn_MapGen_calculateConvexHullOverlapRatio( ...
% polytopes, ...
% varargin...
% )
%
% INPUTS:
%
%     polytopes: the structure of 'polytopes' type that stores the
%     polytopes to be expanded
%
%     (optional inputs)
%
%     fig_num: any number that acts somewhat like a figure number output.
%     If given, this forces the variable types to be displayed as output
%     and as well makes the input check process verbose.
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%     covex_hull_overlap_ratio: portion of overlapping convex hull area to total obstacle area
%
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
%     MATLAB's polyshape object and union object function (method)
%
%
% EXAMPLES:
%
% See the script: script_test_fcn_MapGen_polytopesExpandEvenlyForConcave
% for a full test suite.
