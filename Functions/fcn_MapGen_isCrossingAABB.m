function [isInside] = fcn_MapGen_isCrossingAABB(AABB, test_points)
% fcn_MapGen_isCrossingAABB
% Checks if the line segments between every pair of test points are intersecting
% the given axis-aligned bounding box,
% AABB, returning a matrix of 1' or 0's the same number of rows and columns
% as the number of points where the value at element i,j is 1 if the line
% segment starting at point i and ending at point j intersects
% the AABB. Each line segment must be strictly within the AABB
% - e.g. this function returns "false" if a point is on the "wall" of the AABB.

% FORMAT:
%
%    [ ...
%    isInside ...
%    ] = ...
%    fcn_MapGen_isWithinABBB( ...
%    AABB, ...
%    test_points, ...
%    (fig_num) ...
%    )
%
% INPUTS:
%
%     AABB: the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box, defined in form of [xmin ymin
%     xmax ymax]
%
%     test_points: the test points to check, in form of [x y] where x and
%     y are scalar or column vectors
%
%     (optional inputs)
%
%     fig_num: any number that acts somewhat like a figure number output.
%     If given, this forces the variable types to be displayed as output
%     and as well makes the input check process verbose.
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%     isInside: a matrix of 1's or 0's, one for each pair of test points, with 1
%     meaning that the line segment from test point i to test point j is within
%     intersecting the AABB
