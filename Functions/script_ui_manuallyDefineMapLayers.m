% allow the user to draw polytopes on an opened figure
% store these polytopes in a 2D polytope matrix where each row is a map layer
% (i.e. a set of polytopes defining one type of feature like impassable obstacles
% water features, passable obstacles, rough patches, etc.) and each column is
% a single polytope

% -- first write of script
% TODO(@sjharnett) enforce convexity or break concave polys into convex polys
% TODO(@sjharnett) should multiple map layers be stored in a nxm matrix or an array of arrays?
