% allow the user to draw polytopes on an opened figure
% store these polytopes in a 2D polytope matrix where each row is a map layer
% (i.e. a set of polytopes defining one type of feature like impassable obstacles
% water features, passable obstacles, rough patches, etc.) and each column is
% a single polytope

% 2022_15_Sept by S. Harnett
% -- first write of script
% 2022_16_Sept by S. Harnett
% -- allowing user to set polytope costs and changing from matrices of polytopes to cell array
% TODO(@sjharnett) enforce convexity or break concave polys into convex polys
