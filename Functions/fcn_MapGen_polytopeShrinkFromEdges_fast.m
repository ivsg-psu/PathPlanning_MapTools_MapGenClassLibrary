% fcn_MapGen_polytopeShrinkFromEdges_fast cuts edges off the polytopes
% Each edge is cut so that the entire polytope is trimmed exactly the same
% amount from each edge. This fast variant does NOT return the fully
% populated polytope, nor does it check inputs. It simply calculates the
% verticies field without updating areas, etc.
%
% This is implemented in three steps:
% 1. Calculate the polytope skeleton, or use the skeleton if the user
% provides this as inputs.
%
% 2. Using the cut distance, find the template that is less than or equal
% to the cut distance. If less, then calculate the additional cut and
% project the verticies to their new points based on residual cut.
%
% 3. Convert the resulting verticies into the standard polytope form.

% OUTPUTS:

%       xv: a 1-by-m vector of vertice x-coordinates
%       yv: a 1-by-m vector of vertice y-coordinates
%       distances: a 1-by-m vector of perimeter distances from one point to the
%         next point, distances(i) = distance from vertices(i) to vertices(i+1)
%       mean: centroid xy coordinate of the polytope

% or use the skeleton if the user provides this as inputs.

% We want to use the one that is less than or equal to the cut distance. If
% less, then calculate the additional cut and project the verticies to
% their new points based on residual cut.
