    % sweep vertical bar from left to right
    % generate all points
    % find left most point
    % does this polytope have points both left and right of this point?
    % if not, draw line all the way up and down
    % if so, are the other points above or below this one?
    % if above, draw line below
    % if below, draw line above

    % if we have a list of sides, we can draw until the nearest side
